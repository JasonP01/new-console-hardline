   This extension mod is currently in testing.

   Everything works, but at the moment it
   refuses to compile for Android, which is
   still yet to be tested for support.

   The compile error is related to the
   Kotlin compiler embeddable library,
   which d8 seems to have issues with.

   Further local device configuration will
   be done.

   To build:

   ./gradlew jar

   This builds the current NewConsole source
   code before actually building the extension
   mod itself.
