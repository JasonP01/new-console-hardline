author: "Mnemotechnician (original developer), SMOLKEYS (port maintainer)"

description: '''
The officially acknowledged port of New Console for v147-above.

Adds a console UI superior to the built-in one and the ones provided by any other mods.
User-friendly interface, an actual code editor with [accent]syntax highlighting[] and indentation guides, assistance and more:
A good log panel, execution history - all of that is included in this mod.

In addition to the console, this mod offers:
- An ability to save as many scripts as you want and to either execute them or copy to the console
- An ability to execute scripts when certain events get fired
- A full-blown file browser (be careful, you can cause real harm with that!)

See README.md for more info.
